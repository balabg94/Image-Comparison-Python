# Image-Comparison-Python

This is the result of the first task for the selection process of the startup-box.

This python program let's the user compare two images once the user provides the respective image URL's in the spaces provided.
When run, the program opens a dialogue box enabling the users to interact easily. 
When clicked on the Compare button, a bit of time is taken for image fetching and comparison. Once the comparison is done, the result and the images compared are shown in a new dialogue box. Also the comparison is ranked on a scale of 0 to 100 (100 being perfect match).
